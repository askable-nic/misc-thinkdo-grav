If you present later in this session, you’ll need to demonstrate passion. Passion for something. What something? Well, it’s likely not your product, but what your product actually achieves. Jobs wasn’t passionate about building an awesome computer as much as he was passionate about equipping someone with the potential to be creative. It’s time to take a look at what your product achieves and confirm that all of your team could get seriously passionate about it.

It’s now that you’ll be deciding if you pitch or not, or if all of you pitch or just some of you. The founder of the idea needs to be clear that if anyone isn’t on board, then don’t pretend to be on board. With the members that are serious, you need to work out a dollar figure to put forward to represent how passionate you are. Remember, if successful this money will form up your budget along with double that amount from Orange.
