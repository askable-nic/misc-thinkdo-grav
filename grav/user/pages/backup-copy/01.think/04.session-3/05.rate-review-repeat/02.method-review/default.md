After everyone has rated, in your teams look through the scores on your idea and highlight scores that you want more information about. These could be scores that are significantly higher or lower than how you scored, or significantly different to the average.

Back in the group, each team gets the opportunity to go through the scores that stood out and ask the scorer why they rated a certain way - keep in mind that everybody may bring to the table a different interpretation of an idea or filter. 

Use this time to talk about your idea’s weaker points and discuss how they might be addressed and improved. Get everyone’s feedback and take notes. This is all about building ideas up. Don’t think too incrementally about it though- try to stretch the ideas creatively.
