So, this part is really the flipside of your idea sucks. Think of it like this. What 3 filters exist, that if your idea scored a 10 out of 10 in each, the idea would surely succeed. These filters may be around frequency of use, types of users, virality, customisation, effort, etc.

For example, let’s say you're creating a social app. A successful would be accessed 10+ times a day. You create a filter that is: App must be used 10+ times a day. You then take a look at your current idea and realise that people would only use it 1 time a week. In this case, you’ll rate it around a 2. In the next part, we’ll work on getting this score up.

In the  Idea Rating spreadsheet, enter your chosen idea name, description & filters in preparation for later on in the session. It’s one sheet per _idea_- duplicate sheets if needed
