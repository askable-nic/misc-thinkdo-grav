Another elimination round, this time with plenty of manufactured drama and a dude in a purple sports coat.

1. Individually: We need 3 ideas not 6. Take 2 standard stickers. Decide on your top 2.

2. All in: All together, place your stickers on the relevant cards. Re order the ideas from best to worst. Keep the top 3, bin the rest. Have a teary, chin up.
