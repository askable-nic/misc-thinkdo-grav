Now that you’ve got a clear definition of your product, it’s time to build a case as to why the idea will surely fail.

This is tough process, but think of it as an opportunity to refine and strengthen your idea. After identifying the challenges and flaws in the concept, figure out how they can be fixed, or even better, change the idea so that it’s no longer a problem.

You’ll be smashing your idea to pieces, but by putting it back together it should be stronger than it was before.

Update your concept definition, or write a new one if it’s changed significantly.
