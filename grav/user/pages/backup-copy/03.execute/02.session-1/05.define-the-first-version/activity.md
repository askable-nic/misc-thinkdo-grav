So now that you’ve got a more inspired, bulletproof version of your product, you’ll need to figure out the first step to making it a reality. This phase goes for 8 weeks and in that time you’ll need to build a version of the product, and actually put it in the hands of some users. Take that timeframe into account when deciding what you’re building first - this stuff always takes longer to build than you first think it will.

This version should relate back to your vision, compelling sell & first 1000. Essentially it’s the smallest step towards your vision that delivers the compelling sell to the first 1000.
