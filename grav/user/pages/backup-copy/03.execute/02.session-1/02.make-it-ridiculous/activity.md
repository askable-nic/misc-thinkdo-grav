Time to get outside of your current thinking. The best possible version of your product may still be out there, but you’d never come across by validating it in the market.

Using this [image association tool](http://thinkdo.orangedigital.com.au/ideas/images-2), look at the 4 images to see if any spark a new variation or angle for your idea.

The images are random and they’ll update every 3 minutes, but if you get a set that’s not doing anything for you, feel free to change early by reloading the page. Often the most useful images contain objects and people.
