The bulk of this session is dedicated to working on your MVP, which is what you're probably itching to do, but there's also some tasks designed to make sure you're dedicating your energy to the most important areas. Make sure to give those activities the proper attention, because otherwise you may end up wasting valuable time working on the wrong things.
