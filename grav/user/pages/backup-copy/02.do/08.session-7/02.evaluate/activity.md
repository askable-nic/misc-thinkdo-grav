This is the second last session in this round, so there's not much time left to prove the potential of your idea.

Have a look at the assumptions that you initially set out to prove. What data do you have against each one? Are there any important ones that haven't been properly tested yet?

Make a list of the assumptions that still need to be tested further in order to validate your original hypothesis. Figure out how your experiment(s) can be altered to hit these assumptions, or what new experiments you may need to run.

Update your plan from here until the end of next session, remembering to specify how you plan to allocate your remaining budget. In the plan make sure you're making the most effective use of the time between this session and the next one.
