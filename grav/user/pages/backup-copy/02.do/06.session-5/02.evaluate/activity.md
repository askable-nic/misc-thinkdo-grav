Looking at the analytics, put together a rough funnel of the traffic through your experiment so far. If there are multiple steps that you had your users take, get them all down into a final conversion rate. Take into account _all_ the data sources- these might be on your landing page, or on your acquisition channels.

What do you think engaged people / what didnâ€™t? Can you tell where people drop off in the process? Try and gain as much from the data as you can without having to guess - if you have to guess then your experiment may be missing something.

If you did a split test, can you attribute different success levels to the elements you tested? What does that tell you about the audience?

Does the volume of traffic through your experiment give enough weight to validate / invalidate any assumptions?

**TLDR: What did you learn from your experiment?**
