After looking through the experiment results, how do you feel it went? It's time to make the decision about whether you try and tune the engine by making minor changes or further split tests, or rethink your experiment approach (opt for the former if possible, so that you don't have to start all your learning from scratch).

Also revisit your vision card. The vision shouldn't really be changing at this point, but you may have justification to go a slightly different direction with the other 3 quadrants. Ask yourselves if there's anything you've learned which suggests you might need to change your product as well.

Don't forget about why you're doing all of this - take a moment to gauge your team passion levels. Remember that excitement can be fairly volatile, but passion is more constant.
