So now your budget comes into play, potentially. Your experiment is meaningless unless you have some traffic to it. Spend wisely, you’re using some of your own money here. At the same time, if you go with a super-tight budget, you might find you don’t have enough data to prove or disprove an assumption. There are plenty of options that don’t require spend - reddit, quora, forums, etc. Choose wisely.
