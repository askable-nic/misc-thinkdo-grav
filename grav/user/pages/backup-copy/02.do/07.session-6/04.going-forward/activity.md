What are you going to be working on next session? Make a solid plan so you can hit the ground running.

What will be happening with your experiment in the meantime? Don't waste the valuable hours between now and then. Even if you're not actively working on your experiment, your experiment can be at work testing assumptions, so make sure you set it up to get the most value from that time. Finetuning your acquisition channels during this time may also be valuable.
