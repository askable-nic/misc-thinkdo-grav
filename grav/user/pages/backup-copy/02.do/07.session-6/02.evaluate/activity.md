Make a bit of a plan for the remainder of this do round. This will evolve over time, so map it out how you see it going at this point.

Plans for your main MVP will be a part of this, but if this doesn't test all of your important assumptions, have a think about some secondary experiments which might. Prioritise your time based on the relative importance of testing each assumption.

Also plan out specifically how you're going to allocate the remainder of your budget for rest of the round. It may be wort considering what you can do to gain insights without running ads or spending money.
