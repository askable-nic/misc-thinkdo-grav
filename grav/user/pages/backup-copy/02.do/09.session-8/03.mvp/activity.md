If you've decided to head back to the phase 1 loop, it's time to reflect on what has gone down over the last 4 weeks. This reflection will help you avoid similar issues in future rounds. These questions might help get the reflection started.

1. Review your vision. Are you fully committed to making this vision a reality?
2. What has this phase shown you about what you are passionate about or what you aren't passionate about?
3. Where did you add the most value to this project?
4. Where did you add the least value to this project?
5. What should you have done differently?
6. What things do you need to do before you head into another phase 2?

Once you've got this together and any other thoughts, we'll run through these with you before the session is up. After that, get a head start on loop 1, start thinking about what you are truly passionate about.
