Whether your heading into phase 2 or phase 3, it's time to let the data do some of the talking.

Pull everything together to build a case for why you should be heading into either phase 2 or 3. Remember, building an MVP is all about validated learning, so what can you prove with the data that you've gathered?

Why? Why should you be heading into this phase? If your pitching for phase 3, we need to see that you are deadly serious about making this idea reality. If you're pitching for phase 2, it better not simply be because it's the easy option. Pitching for phase 2 means that you know that your vision is right, but you haven't been able to find the right product to fit it. 

Either way, get a quick presentation together and build a case as to why you should be moving forward.
