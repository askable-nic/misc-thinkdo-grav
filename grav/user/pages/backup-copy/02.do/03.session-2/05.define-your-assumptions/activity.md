Now that you have a hypothesis down, you want to list out any assumptions that impact the hypothesis. Get a list of 10 down, then prioritise them from most important to least important. There is likely a ‘leap of faith’ assumption in there that needs to clearly be #1. This type of assumption is the make or break assumption that will ensure or prevent your concept from working.
