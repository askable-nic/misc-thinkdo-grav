This time has been put aside to get you thinking about your audience before tests are up and running. You may know your first 1000, now you need to work out how you are going to reach them. It’s likely your budget will come into play here, but take this time to work out the smartest way to reach your audience, so come next session you can hit the ground running. If you’re in a team, you may not need all members on this step.
