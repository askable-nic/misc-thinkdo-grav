Time to make your MVP real. If you’re in a team, allocate tasks to get this done as efficiently as possible, if you’re solo, work out the sequence in which you need to complete tasks. The sooner your first MVP is completed the sooner you can measure and validate / disprove your assumptions. Think smaller, always think smaller. If necessary, just aim to test one assumption. Make sure you build your MVP using the smartest tools - check out [OneMonth Growth Hacking](https://onemonth.com/courses/growth-hacking) (day 3, 5 and 7)  for ideas on split testing and different tools.
