First, all in Round 2, watch <a href="https://clip.mn/video/yt-5_0dVHMpJlo" target="_blank">this video</a> together

Find your first 1000, is all about targeting an incredibly tight niche of people. Based on the above video, your objective is not to own a small part of a big market but rather a big part of a small market. You need to define the 1000 people most likely to purchase your product based on your compelling sell. 

One rule, you cannot narrow your audience down demographically unless your product truly depends on it. Rather, look for commonalities in an audience that are separate from demographic information. Maybe your product is just for people who have applied for over 100 jobs in the last year, or people that have quit their business, got a job, then started up a business again.
