Now the tricky part. How do you use your compelling sell to get the first 1000 on board while making a logical first step towards your ultimate vision? Broadly speaking, what can you create or do, to fit all of these parts together. Getting a ‘How?’ down may require a reworking of The Compelling Sell or The First 1000. Remember, the ‘How?’ does not need to fulfill the vision, but rather make a logical first step towards it. Keep refining them until your how fits together. Next session you’ll be bringing this how to life through an MVP.
