Right, so it’s all go now. You’re first MVP has to be up and running ASAP. Remember, if it isn’t testing your assumptions, that data you get is going to be completely pointless. So hold tight to the assumptions you’ve outlined and the hypothesis you finalised last session. Also, running a web based test without split testing is a little pointless, so make sure you run some intelligents splits.
