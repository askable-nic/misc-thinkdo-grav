So you're now in the final session of phase 2. At this point you have 3 options for moving forward:

1. You believe your data has validated your idea and vision, you pitch to move forward into phase 3.
2. You believe your vision is right, but you're data shows that your idea isn't, so you re-commence phase 2 from a different angle.
3. You believe the data has shown that there is almost no way forward, you head back to the phase 1 loop.

There's a few things to consider before making this decision. Naturally, excitement is high around the conception of the idea, and much lower as you start to execute it. However, plenty of successful businesses would simply not exist if they simply bailed because it got difficult. Welcome to reality. You need to look at your vision and confirm that you (and your team) are fully committed to it. If you are fully passionate about your vision, it's probably not time to bail yet. On the other hand, heading back to the phase 1 loop is not the end of the world, you may be much clearer on your passion now and ready to go. 

Take some time to consider all options as individuals. You don't all need to make the same decision, some people may head back to the loop while others may want to push to phase 3. 

The final thing to consider is that re-commencing phase 2 will requires additional budget input.
