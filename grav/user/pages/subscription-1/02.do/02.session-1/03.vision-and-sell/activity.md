Before we get into creating experiments and testing assumptions, we need to get a clear on where you are heading. Through the next hour, youâ€™ll be working on the vision for your product and the compelling sell. The vision defines what you truly desire to achieve with your product. Your vision will likely be the flipside of your problem applied to a significant group of people. Your vision needs to be something that all team members could seriously commit to achieving over the next 5 years. 

The compelling sell, sums your product up into a sentence or two, that will inspire someone to buy it or use it. It you could only tell someone one thing about your product, this would be it.

Record both of these on the A4 card.
