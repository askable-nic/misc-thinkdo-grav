In a doc, get down a summary of your MVP experiment. Write an overview of the experiment, detail the hypothesis and run through each of the assumptions you intend to test. For each assumption write down a benchmark metric that proves it is either true or false. This will act as a reference moving forward to ensure the MVP doesnâ€™t drift.
