Right, hypothesis down, key assumptions highlighted. You now want to create an early MVP to logically test as many of the high priority assumptions as possible. Before you go too far, it’s going to be worth running through [this resource](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T_TcI2xqhDF1VryivId6M_FNRuYPQqZac1J4ZR8hl0Y).  
[This video](https://onemonth.com/courses/mvp/steps/the-buffet-of-mvp) will also clarify some of the different MVP types and their benefits.

For now, you need to select the one that is going to test your most important assumptions in the shortest amount of time. As your assumptions are proven or falsified, your product and hypothesis will change in order to find a proper market fit. Go!

Also keep in mind that in order to test your assumptions adequately, you’ll need to run plenty of people through your experiment, which will take time. You’ll probably need to allow about 2 weeks for this, which means that your MVP needs to be ready for market next week, so scale it accordingly.
