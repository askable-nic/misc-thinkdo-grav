This is a casual pitch, however it needs to be clear what you’re idea is and what your team is about. Don’t feel the need to put a big slide deck together, rather, spend your time clearing up exactly what your idea is. Bigger isn’t better. Rather than let your idea grow through this, tighten it up. Pitches will take place around the big table one team at a time.
