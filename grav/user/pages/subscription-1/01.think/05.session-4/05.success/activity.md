You’ll find out if you’re successful after all teams have presented. If successful, your team will get briefed on next steps. If you aren’t successful, be happy. The aim of the game is not to get through rounds as fast as you can, but to get through a round with something you are genuinely passionate about. You’ll immediately have another chance on this starting next week.
