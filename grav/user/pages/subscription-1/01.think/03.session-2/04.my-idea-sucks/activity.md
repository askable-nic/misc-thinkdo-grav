This is your opportunity to build a compelling case as to why your idea will surely fail. Get every single flaw out on the table. You might even find it helpful to do some slides up. Remember, the objective is convince the rest of the team that it will fail. 

Why? Way too many ideas just keep moving forward because no one was willing to point out the flaws. In reality though, if you point out flaws, you can then spend time solving them and ultimately make the idea much stronger.
