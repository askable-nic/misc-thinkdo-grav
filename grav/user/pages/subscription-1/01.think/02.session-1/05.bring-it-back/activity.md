It's time for the first elimination round. Cue suspensful music and a bunch of infuriatingly timed ad breaks.

1. Individually: We need 6 ideas not 21. Take 1 immunity sticker and 3 standard stickers. Decide on which idea you want to give immunity, then decide on your next top 3.
2. All in: All together, place your stickers on the relevant cards. Re order the ideas from best to worst. Keep the top 6, bin the rest. Have a cry, then carry on.
