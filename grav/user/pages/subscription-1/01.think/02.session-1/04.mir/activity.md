Time to get down some specific ideas and inspirations.

1. Individually: Come up with 7 ideas each that could solve this, then come up with 5 inspirations each that have nailed this. Write them on individual post-its.
2. All in: Pitch your ideas and get rid of any duplicates. Stick your ideas to a card. Now run through your inspirations, dedupe and tag them to any ideas.
