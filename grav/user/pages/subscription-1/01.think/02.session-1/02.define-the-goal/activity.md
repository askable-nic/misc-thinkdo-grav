First thing's first. It's time to get the problem you're trying to solve on the table. Now it's time to work out what we want to walk away with at the end of this session? Get a singular goal down in one sentence that everyone agrees on. If you're finding it tricky, take the problem to be solved and flip it into a challenge that can be represented as a goal. Now. Why? Why is this so important? Make sure you are clear on the goal and purpose before you proceed. Write them down.
