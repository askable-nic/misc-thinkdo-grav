Time to shatter these ideas on the floor, then pick up the pieces and see if you can put them back together in a way that makes them stronger.

1. Take 1 idea each, the idea you care about the most
2. Build a compelling case as to why this idea will surely fail
3. Present it
4. As a team, see if you can overcome these flaws, if not, bin it.
