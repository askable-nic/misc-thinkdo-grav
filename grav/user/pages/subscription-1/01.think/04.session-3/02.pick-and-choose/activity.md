You’ve currently got 2 ideas. Is there one that’s clearly stronger than the other at this point? Are you torn equally between the 2? Is there some combination of the ideas that has the best potential?

Define the current best version of your idea to move forward through the filtering process. It is possible to take 2 ideas through here, but you’ll need to work twice as hard through the next couple of activities.

If you’re merging ideas, make sure you go with the overlap, don’t just try to squish 2 ideas into 1.
