How is your Execute phase tracking so far? What's still left to do, and can you realistically achieve that in the remaining sessions? 

Watch out for scope creep. Don’t be spending time on anything that’s not essential to your MVP- ie. things that don’t directly contribute to achieving your vision / testing an assumption.

This is an exercise that needs to be prioritised **every** session to make sure you’re always on track.
