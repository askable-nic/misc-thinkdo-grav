Some clearly defined metrics will provide you with a goal that you can work towards. Heading in blindly to phase 3 will only lead to wasted time. As a team, work out what metrics you want to hold yourself to. Itâ€™s likely that there will be 1 primary metric and a couple of secondary metrics. The metrics you select should be achievable but really stretch you. Ultimately, they should be metrics that you believe build a compelling case to progress into phase 4. Keep in mind that your metrics should have you progress towards the vision that you outlined.

Metrics may be related to: Users, Usage, Conversion Rates, Revenue, Customer Acquisition Cost, Feedback / Interaction, Viral Coefficient, Referral, etc.
