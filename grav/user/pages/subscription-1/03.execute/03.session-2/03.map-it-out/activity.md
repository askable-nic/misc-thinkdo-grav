Make a list of all the tasks that you’ll need to complete to make the first version of your product a reality. You haven’t got very much time, so prioritise tasks based on your key metrics. Don’t forget to think about how you’re going to acquire your users- that will take time and effort as well, so you need to account for that in your plan. 

Assign each task to the person responsible for it to make sure it gets done.
